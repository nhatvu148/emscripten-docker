# emscripten-docker

[**_Emscripten_**](https://emscripten.org/) is an Open Source LLVM to JavaScript compiler. Using Emscripten you can:

* Compile C and C++ code into JavaScript
* Compile any other code that can be translated into LLVM bitcode into JavaScript.
* Compile the C/C++ runtimes of other languages into JavaScript, and then run code in those other languages in an indirect way (this has been done for Python and Lua)!

[**_Docker_**](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/) is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications. By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
