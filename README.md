# emscripten-docker

[**_Emscripten_**](https://emscripten.org/) is an Open Source LLVM to JavaScript compiler. Using Emscripten you can:

* Compile C and C++ code into JavaScript
* Compile any other code that can be translated into LLVM bitcode into JavaScript.
* Compile the C/C++ runtimes of other languages into JavaScript, and then run code in those other languages in an indirect way (this has been done for Python and Lua)!
